## 1. Executive Summary

The USC Suzanne Dworak-Peck School of Social Work seeks to deploy an AI-powered simulation platform to prepare Bachelor and Master of Social Work students for real-world practice.

The platform will:
- Provide realistic AI-driven virtual client simulations with voice interaction  
- Represent diverse clients aligned with ADEIB principles  
- Integrate with Canvas and Brightspace via LTI 1.3  
- Provide immediate AI-generated feedback and analytics  
- Align with CSWE competencies  
- Support both asynchronous and synchronous delivery  

OxbridgeEducation proposes a hybrid AI avatar + LMS-integrated platform with **full IP ownership transferred to USC**.
