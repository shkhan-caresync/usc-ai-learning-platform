## 1. Executive Summary

The USC Suzanne Dworak-Peck School of Social Work seeks to deploy an advanced AI-powered simulation platform to prepare Bachelor and Master of Social Work students for practice with individuals, families, groups, organizations, and communities.

This platform will:
- Provide realistic, AI-driven virtual client simulations with natural conversational voice  
- Represent diverse client identities aligned with ADEIB principles  
- Complement community-based practicum education with structured, repeatable simulations  
- Integrate with Canvas and Brightspace via LTI 1.3  
- Deliver immediate AI-generated feedback and after-action reports  
- Log audio, video, transcripts, and behavioral data for assessment  
- Align with CSWE competencies and accreditation requirements
- Mobile responsive web app
- TODO Accesibily  

OxbridgeEducation proposes a hybrid system combining:
- A robust LTI-integrated avatar and media platform  
- A social-work-specific AI-driven simulation, assessment, and analytics engine  

USC will receive full and exclusive ownership of all source code, system architecture, simulation engines, and documentation.
