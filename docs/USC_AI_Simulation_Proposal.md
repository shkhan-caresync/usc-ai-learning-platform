## 31. Testing & Quality Assurance Strategy

### Testing Approach
- **Unit testing**: Comprehensive unit tests for all backend services and frontend components
- **Integration testing**: End-to-end testing of LTI integration, AI interactions, and data flows
- **Security testing**: Vulnerability scanning, penetration testing, and security code review
- **Performance testing**: Load testing to ensure platform handles expected user volumes
- **Accessibility testing**: Automated and manual basic accessibility compliance testing
- **Browser compatibility testing**: Testing across supported browsers and devices
- **User acceptance testing (UAT)**: Pilot group testing with real faculty and students

### Quality Assurance Process
- **Code reviews**: All code changes reviewed by senior developers
- **Automated testing**: CI/CD pipeline runs automated tests on every commit
- **Test coverage**: Minimum 80% code coverage for critical paths
- **Bug tracking**: Comprehensive bug tracking and resolution process
- **Regression testing**: Full regression suite run before each release

### Testing Timeline
- **Continuous testing**: Throughout development lifecycle
- **Formal QA phase**: Dedicated 4-week QA phase in Month 6
- **UAT phase**: 2-week user acceptance testing with pilot groups
- **Pre-launch testing**: Final testing before production deployment

## 32. Acceptance Criteria & Sign-Off Process

### Milestone Acceptance Criteria
Each milestone includes specific acceptance criteria that must be met before payment:

- **Phase 1.1**: Architecture diagrams approved, UX mockups signed off, SRS document accepted
- **Phase 1.2**: Backend API functional with test results, LTI integration verified working
- **Phase 1.3**: Frontend features demonstrated, faculty authoring console tested and approved
- **Phase 1.4**: AI simulations functional, avatar integration working, assessment engine tested
- **Phase 1.5**: QA test results reviewed, security assessment passed, analytics verified
- **Phase 1.6**: Production launch successful, training completed, IP transfer completed

### Sign-Off Process
1. **Deliverable review**: USC project sponsor reviews milestone deliverables
2. **Testing verification**: USC verifies deliverables meet acceptance criteria
3. **Sign-off document**: USC project sponsor signs milestone acceptance document
4. **Invoice payment**: Payment processed within 30 days of sign-off

### Dispute Resolution
- **Issue identification**: Any issues identified during review documented
- **Resolution period**: 5 business days to address and resolve issues
- **Re-review**: Updated deliverables reviewed again before sign-off
- **Escalation**: Unresolved disputes escalated to project steering committee
